# Mock Data

Full Disclosure - this mock data script was prepared ahead of time for the hackathon. All hackathon code was written during the event except for these python data-minimization scripts.

To use the python scripts:
```

python3 mock-data-prep.py original/USAID\ Monitoring\ Demo\ v1\ 2025-03-04\ 19_00_01.json minimized/usaid-sanitation-demo.json

python3 write-csv.py minimized/usaid-sanitation-demo.json csv/
Saved FormVersions to csv/FormVersions.csv

```

4. I generally don't write much frontend code, my LWC implementation shows it ðŸ˜…
5. Some of these agent actions fail during debugging but work when used in the actual Agent
